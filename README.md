This is the implementation of my minor project model
Here i have used my used my convolution saved model instead of transfer learning model which is too big for github
so to run change my_model_weights_resnet50_trainable_tt.h5 to my_model3conlayer.h5
=======
# Pothole_detection_model_approach<br>
The aim is to detect whether an image contains potholes or not. <br>
The final approach used is transfer learning ResNet50 with model fine tunning and hyper parameter tunning. <br>
the metrics used to calculate it are accuracy and F1 score with an accuracy of 98%. <br>
